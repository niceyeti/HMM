"""
Generates data from two separate conditional discrete distributions representing CPG islands, which are
just a convenient application of discrete conditional data sources. This model is nice because
there are only two hidden states, which is a typical use-case for binary classification of sequences.

The following data is from http://web.stanford.edu/class/stats366/exs/HMM1.html

This script just generates sequences from each distribution independently, then concatenates them.
The hidden transition matrix is what we are trying to model, hence it is not given.
 
The sequences are formatted for consumption by the DiscreteDataset class, which reads in <hidden,emission> pairs
from a file. So the output of this will be something like:

<+,A>
<+,C>
<+,A>
... (all the rest of the emissions generated from the + model)
<-,A>
<-,T>
<-,T>
... (all the rest of the emissions generated from the - model)
